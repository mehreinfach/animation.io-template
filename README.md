# Create interactive art, together.

Animation Framework Developer Edition

## Animation for hackers, painters and storytellers

Animation.io is an open source, interactive and extendable animation framework built from pure JavaScript and HTML5. Complex yet highly optimized animation logic is hidden behind a simple and accessible scripting language. Hackers, artists and storytellers can quickly set up shop together to create stunning interactive art.

**Hackers** can extend the code via plugins that connect to a simple and beautiful API.

**Painters, artists and illustrators** can drop in pictures, write super simple scripts and bring their art to life.

**Storytellers** can tell interactive stories and script their characters' behaviors themselves.
